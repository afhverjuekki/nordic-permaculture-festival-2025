Diane Nunberg - "Mindfulness Meditation"

Diane Nunberg, a mindfulness meditation teacher, will offer instruction and guided meditation for beginners and/or anyone with experience that wishes to practice together. We'll explore mindfulness benefits using techniques that bring forth awareness of the body, breath, and mindfulness in nature. We will also discuss ways to develop a regular practice. The techniques and philosophy will be secular with a chance to explore further in the optional Q & A sessions.
