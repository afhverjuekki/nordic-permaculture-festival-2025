Hildur DagbjÃ¶rt - "Make a permaculture song"

Songs are such a powerful way to connect to our core. In this workshop we will let creativity lead us while co-creating a song about what matters to us. There will be options for either creating fresh lyrics to melodies that already exist and/or to create both a melody and lyrics. There will be a possibility to let the new permaculture songs shine and be enjoyed by others already on the Open Mic on Saturday night.
