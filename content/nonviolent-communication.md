Nonviolent Communication

It's a bit funny, because the name doesn't quite fit. Nonviolent Communication is definitely not a communication technique. It is a mindset and a deeper understanding about our needs. It is getting constantly surprised by the positive effects it can have on your life quality and connections with other humans each time you are able to get in touch with that mindset and to act according to it. Connection with yourself, your partners, children, parents, coworkers, friends and strangers. In this workshop you'll get introduced to this mindset that is the backbone of Nonviolent Communication and go through some practices where you can get in touch with the profound difference it can have on you. Self-empathy and self-forgiveness will play a role in that exploration. It's not a communication technique - but it is really likely that you will start to communicate differently when you are seeing each situation through a different lens.
