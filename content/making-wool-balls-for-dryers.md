Hulda Brynjólfsdóttir - "Making wool dryer balls"

Hulda has been running the mini-mill Uppspuni for 8 years where they spin yarn and make products from the wool from sheep from their farm and also by request from other farms that want to get yarn made from their specific sheep. In this workshop Hulda will introduce you to how to work with wool and you can participate in felting wool from her farm into dryer balls.
