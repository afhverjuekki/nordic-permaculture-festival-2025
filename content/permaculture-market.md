Permaculture Market & Swap: Sharing Goods, Skills, and Ideas

Join us for a vibrant, community-based event where you can explore practical skills such as fermenting foods, making kefir and kimchi, creating herbal blends out of dry herbs and fermented ones, sprouting seeds and legumes, and much more. While this is not a full hands-on workshop, you'll be able to taste the homemade produce, ask questions, and get useful tips and recipes directly from the makers in an informal, friendly setting. Everyone is welcome to share somethingâ€”whether it's homemade goods, practical skills, or ideasâ€”related to permaculture, ecological living, and self-sufficiency.
