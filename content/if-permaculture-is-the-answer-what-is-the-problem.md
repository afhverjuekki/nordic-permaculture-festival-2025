Erkki Pöytäniemi - "If permaculture is the answer, what is the problem?"

Those of us who are active in permaculture are probably convinced that permaculture offers answers to critical and urgent questions and challenges we face on personal or societal level. But what are the challenges and problems we want to solve with permaculture? We all know some answers to that and we have seen presentations listing them. But have we thought of all aspects, what is important for us and others and do we share the same views? Are we in the same bubble of are there many permaculture bubbles? Can our bubbles pollinate each other? Join the adventure and let's find out!
