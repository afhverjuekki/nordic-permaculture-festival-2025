Helena Hansd√≥ttir Aspelund - "Wood Carving"

Kids and grownups join together in this workshop where there's space for both beginners and more experienced wood carvers. If you have a carving knife or other wood carving tools, then bring them along. We'll have some tools to borrow to those that do not have tools of their own. Wood carving is such a fun activity where you can let the forms of the wood guide your creativity and create something unique.
