Anita RÃ¼bberdt - "Minimalism and Permaculture: Designing Abundance with Less Stuff"

In this interactive workshop, we explore how permaculture principles and ethics can guide us toward simpler, more intentional living. Through personal storytelling, group reflection, and practical design tools, we'll look at how to let go of clutter â€” physical, mental, or emotional â€” and design lives that are abundant, regenerative, and low-impact. Participants will be invited to reflect on their own patterns of consumption and accumulation, learn to apply permaculture tools like zone mapping and needs & yields analysis, and begin designing a space or life system rooted in "just enough."
