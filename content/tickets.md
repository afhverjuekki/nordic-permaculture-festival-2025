Ticket prices are kept at a really low cost to have the festival accessible to a wide range of people. All the amazing and experienced people that hold the numerous workshops are donating their work in leading workshops in order for us all to be able to learn and enjoy time together.  The ticket price covers food costs and some additional costs regarding facilities for the festival.

Early Bird tickets are now sold out.
