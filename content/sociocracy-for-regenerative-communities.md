Ruth Marie Kondrup - "Sociocracy for Regenerative Communities: Sharing Power, Strenghtening Action".

How can we design our groups as wisely as we design our gardens? How do we share power without losing momentum â€” and root decisions in care for people, planet, and future generations? In this participatory workshop, we explore the basics of sociocracy, a governance method aligned with permaculture ethics and principles. Like ecosystems, sociocratic structures are decentralised, adaptive, and resilient â€“ designed to nourish collaboration, diversity, and shared responsibility.
