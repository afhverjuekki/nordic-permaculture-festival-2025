Kate Crowe - “Children Draw Health”

The Children’s Voices Centre (Australia), in collaboration with the World Health Organization, invites children around the world to create a picture that answers the following:

- “What makes you healthy?”
- “Who helps you be healthy?”
- “Where do you go to get healthier?”
- “What would your ideal hospital or health service look like?”

We want to hear lots of different perspectives on "health" and permaculture kids' perspectives need to be represented! In this workshop children will have the opportunity to create an artwork responding to one of the prompt questions and submit their art.
