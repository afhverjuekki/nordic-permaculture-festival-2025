Krist√≠n Eik - "Improvisation"

Let loose and get into the flow of improvisational theater. Playful approach to theater where spontaneity is the name of the game and you won't have to remember any lines. Enjoy being part of creating the theater piece in real time as it happens. You can expect plenty of laughter and co-creation of both interesting and silly small theater pieces. Improvisation is great for practicing creative problem solving, communication - and teamwork skills. This workshop fits well for anyone wanting fun and collaboration. No previous experience with theater is needed to take part.
