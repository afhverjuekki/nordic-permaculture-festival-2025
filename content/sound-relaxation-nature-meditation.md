Marina Ermina - "Sound relaxation and nature meditation"

Sound session and nature meditation with Marina is a journey through the power of sound - an ancient practice used across cultures to bring calm, clarity, and emotional balance. Throughout history people have turned to instruments for their healing qualities. Singing bowls have deep roots in Buddhist traditions where monks used them to aid meditation. In the 20th century these bowls reached the West and are now widely used to support mental and emotional well-being. Marina discovered singing bowls during her travels in Nepal over a decade ago. Since then she has shared their healing vibrations with people of different ages, beliefs, backgrounds, and nationalities. Marina brings deep intention to her practice focusing on appreciation and love for nature - a naturally unifying experience, a "naked state" beyond labels... At the end of each session, she gently guides participants toward this connection inviting them to reflect on the incredible natural world which is the primary source of life for us all. P.S. Little ones are invited too - just supervise them gently so that the atmosphere remains peaceful for everyone.
