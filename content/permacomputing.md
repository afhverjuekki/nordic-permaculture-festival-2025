Jack Armitage - "Permacomputing: What, Why and How?"

Permacomputing is an emerging subject of interest where the principles and practices of permaculture are applied to computing. The goal of permacomputing is to understand how we can redefine and reshape computing - in all of its theoretical, material and practical forms, in the short and long-term - so that it can provide appropriate, ethical, fair and caring capabilities to humans, other living beings, and the Earth. This workshop will take the format of a guided overview of the topic as it currently stands along with some personal stories, followed by a group discussion, breakout discussions and final group sharing.
