We will see the real work of fixing an old wall that is closing the big opening of a historical cave. The cave dates back to 1578 and was used as a place for the parliament in the area. Since then it has been used as a gathering place, for storing food and giving sheep shelter. You will get an introduction to the technique of using stones as building materials and you will see the real time work in practice. Sigurbj√∂rn is a professional stoneworker and has a lot of experience. Helena has been learning the technique and loves every part of the work and the function of the stones.
