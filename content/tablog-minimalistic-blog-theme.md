## Join Us for the Nordic Permaculture Festival in Iceland! 

Get ready for an unforgettable gathering of nature lovers, changemakers, and permaculture enthusiasts! The Nordic Permaculture Festival has been traveling across the Nordic countries since 2011, and this year, it’s landing in Iceland 7th to 10th August
This festival is all about connection, learning, and hands-on action! We’re here to grow networks, swap knowledge, and share inspiring ways to regenerate our planet’s resources. Together, we’ll co-create a space for a more abundant and resilient future—for both people and the Earth. 

## Where in Iceland?

The site for the festival this year is Kirkjulækjakot in Fljótshlíð. 1,5 hours drive from Reykjavík, 7,5 hours drive from the Smyril line ferry from Denmark. The nearest town is Hvolsvöllur, to which there are public buses, we will also have a festival bus picking up passengers on Thursday and back to Hvolsvöllur on the Sunday after the festival.
In Kirkjulækjakot there’s a complete camping site for those that bring their camping gear.  There’s also plenty of 4-6 person rooms that can be booked.  Either as shared rooms with other festival participants or rented as a private room.

## Sign up now and get excited! 

The lineup of workshop leaders is shaping up, and we can’t wait to share what’s in store! Expect a rich and diverse program packed with practical, hands-on workshops, insightful discussions, and exciting deep dives into permaculture wisdom.
There will be a variety of workshops to choose from, and a kids program as well.  Whether you're curious about soil health, ecosystem restoration, mending, communication, mindful nature connection, or community resilience, there will be something for everyone!
This is an opportunity to connect with like minded people, learn new skills and have a lot of fun!
