Thomas Pausz - "Pollinating the Permaculture Greenhouse".

This hands-on and imaginative workshop invites participants to co-create and prototype new strategies for pollinating plants and flowers in Icelandic greenhouses — without relying on imported pollinators. As climate and ecological constraints challenge our traditional reliance on bees and bumblebees, we will explore speculative and practical alternatives to support local permaculture systems.
