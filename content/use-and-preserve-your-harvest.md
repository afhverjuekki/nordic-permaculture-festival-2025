Dagný Guðmundsdóttir - "Use and preserve veggies"

Want to grow food? Or are you already growing food? The big question is always "How to use the harvest and how to preserve it?" You want to be able to enjoy your homegrown foods all through winter. Dagný and her partner have been growing loads of food in their rural permaculture homestead in Iceland for many years and are mostly self-sufficient with veggies. In this workshop Dagný will share her tried and trusted ways to preserve and use the abundance before the winter sets in. There will also be a chance for all participants to share their favourite recipes and ways to use their abundant harvest. We'll all walk away from this workshop with a treasure bank of methods and recipes!
