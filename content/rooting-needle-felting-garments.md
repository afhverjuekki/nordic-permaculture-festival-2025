Þórey Hannesdóttir - "Rooting" for unwanted garments - Felting workshop

Learn how felting with wool can be used to mend clothes and to upcycle them. Creating unique and playful patterns inspired by nature. Pimp up those clothes with plant patterns or insects and give them new life and a playful look! Visible mending is really in the wind these years and mending is surely something to show off and be proud of. Felting is a method that can make mending accessible without any precise stitching or detailed work. Let loose with a felting needle, where you just continuously, wildly stab the garment!
