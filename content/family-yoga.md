Marina Ermina - "Family Yoga"

Family Yoga with Marina is a fun and healthy activity for both parents and children. Marina has been teaching yoga around the world for over a decade, with a vision to bring wellbeing to everyone who needs it and to help little ones build health and resilience from an early age. Together, we'll go on a playful adventure, pretending to be animals and moving our bodies in creative ways. We'll stretch, strengthen, and try simple breathing exercises that support both physical and mental wellbeing. It's also a great way to bond as a family while doing something good for our bodies and minds. Kids learn best by example - when parents are having fun, children naturally join in! ðŸ™‚ P.S. Parents are responsible for keeping an eye on their own children to make sure the flow and atmosphere are respectful for everyone. We trust you've got this!
