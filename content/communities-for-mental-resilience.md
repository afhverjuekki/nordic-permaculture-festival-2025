Monika Bar - "Building Communities for Mental Resilience"

How can we design a community with mental health and resilience in mind? What are the habits, physical and social environment, and governance structures that best build and safeguard the mental health of community members? In this workshop, we will draw on both modern research regarding what constitutes "mental health" - and how best to build it - as well as the participants' experience of creating and living in their own communities. Our aim will be to not only walk away with a set of practical tools and measures that participants can try out in their own communities, but also to start what will hopefully be a longer term conversation about what works and what doesn't.
