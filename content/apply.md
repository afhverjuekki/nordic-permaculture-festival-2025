Do you have permaculture related knowledge you'd like to share during the festival this year? If so, we encourage you to apply to be a workshop leader. Applications are open until the 7th of July.

We're hoping for a wide variety of workshops so please don't hesitate to apply. Former years have included workshops on topics such as food systems and ecofeminism, regenerative agriculture, gong baths, utilisation of nettles and mindful connection to nature.
