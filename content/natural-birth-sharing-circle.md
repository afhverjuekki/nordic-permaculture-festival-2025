Hildur DagbjÃ¶rt - "Natural Birth sharing circle"

Get in touch with the empowering and positive experience it can be to experience natural birth. Birth can be the most natural act we will do in our life, where we really get in touch with the power within, the amazing capacity of our bodies and our inner nature. This is a space to share stories about birth, submerging in listening to these greatly personal experiences and gain deeper understanding about how the one giving birth has full autonomy over the process. Learn how your presence can support and protect the birthing zone when someone is giving birth.
